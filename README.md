Making Chess Ai available on the web.
###### Follow along with my progress on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hEI5JMIi/chessweb-ai)

## Prerequisites
 _I suggest running the setup commands from within a virtualenv or conda env to limit pollution_
* Python3.6+
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` _(from project root)_
* `python server.py` _uses $PORT or 8080_

## Contributing
Fork `master`, make your edits, and push up a PR with a description of what you did and why. I'll merge as many PRs as I can!
